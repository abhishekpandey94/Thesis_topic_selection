Thesis proposed Topic 2
Analysing the impact of creative attributes and contextual parameters on the responsivity towards a digital ad campaign.

The ad creative and the contextual setting in which an ad is placed play an important role in deciding the user response towards a particluar impression. In this project we take a data driven approach analysing the impact of creative attributes like dominant color, label detection, product placement, human presence, etc and contextual parameters like site domain category, device type, supply type, etc on the towards a digital impression.  
We will leverage Google’s Cloud Vision API (industry best) to extract image feature and club this with the ad serving data (restricted access granted by MiQ) to create a master data set which powers our interpretable models to see how the creative and the contextual parameters a creative is served in impact the response to a particular ad.
An aggregated sample will be provided for reference. We plan to train the model based on ad servings across 20 advertisers across categories like auto, travel and education to train and test the model.
